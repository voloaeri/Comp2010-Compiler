\section{Introduction}

This algorithm uses five principle data structures and a recursive method to reduce the given bytecode as much as possible. In brief overview, a reduction is found, the instructions are changed, and the the process repeats until no more changes and can occur and hence no further optimization is possible.  It’s important to note that all three simple, constant, and dynamic folding occur within the same method performFolding.  This report is organized by the descriptions of the data structures and then explanations of the crucial methods.
